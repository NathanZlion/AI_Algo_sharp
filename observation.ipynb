    "### 1. Autocorrection Tool:\n",
    "An Autocorrection tool is an AI-based system designed to assist users in automatically correcting spelling or typing errors in their text. This tool utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the input text and identify potential errors or inconsistencies. It compares the words or phrases against a dictionary or language model to determine if they match known correct words or phrases. When an error is detected, the Autocorrection tool suggests a corrected version, replacing the erroneous text with the most likely intended word or phrase. The system may also consider contextual information, such as nearby words or grammar rules, to enhance the accuracy of the autocorrection suggestions. Autocorrection tools are commonly used in word processors, text messaging applications, and other text input interfaces to improve the speed and accuracy of text composition.\n",
